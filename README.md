**Robot War**<br>

I found this project to be particularly intriguing because it involved learning new techniques and applying object-oriented programming concepts in C++ coding. <br>
Implementing these new concepts to execute the logic of the project made it a truly memorable experience for me. <br>

***HighLight:*** <br>

**Super Class Inheritance:** Utilized a superclass Robot to create unique robot types like RoboCop and Terminator.<br>
**Operator Overloading:** Overloaded operators within the Robot class to define robot actions.<br>
**Circular Linked List:** Used a circular linked list to manage all the robots in the simulation.<br>
**Queue for Killed Robots:** Implemented a queue to collect and return killed robots back to the linked list for continued fighting.<br>
**Double Linking:** Achieved double linking of robots with their controllers through header file compilation.<br>
**Memory Management:** Ensured proper memory management for dynamic pointers.<br>
**Exception Handling:** Incorporated exception handling to address potential memory leaks.<br>
**Algorithm Optimization:** Focused on optimizing algorithms for the controller, linked list, and robots.<br>

This project showcases various advanced C++ techniques and concepts, making it a significant and memorable achievement.<br>
